New data, new questions, old problems? Online behavioral data in social science research

Records of individuals’ online activities obtained from devices like personal computers and smartphones have received a lot of interest in the social sciences in recent years. Many have praised such data for allowing fine-grained observations of individuals’ online activities which would be impossible with more traditional data sources such as surveys. Recent work, however, warns that many data quality aspects of these novel data are so far poorly under- stood. As the number of observations can quickly reach several millions, researchers seem tempted to treat online behavioral data as gold standard, ignore what their data may be missing, and which other systematic biases may be present. In this talk, I present both applied and methodological work using online behavioral data in a typical social science setting. First, using within-between random effects models, I show how online behavioral data combined with a panel survey allows us to understand the effects of news media consumption from populist alternative news platforms on individuals’ political attitudes. Second, I show that online behavioral data, although containing detailed records of individuals’ social media use, are far from being complete. Using hidden Markov models, combined online behavioral data, survey records, and donated social media data, I show that the online behavioral data seem to completely fail in capturing social media use for about one third of the sample. I emphasize the need for researchers to navigate the complexities of online behavioral data, highlighting potentials and limitations.

Implementing and Adjusting a Non-probability Web Survey: Experiences of EVENs (Survey on the Impact of COVID19 on Ethnic Minorities in the United Kingdom)

Natalie Shlomo
Professor of Social Statistics, University of Manchester

This is joint work with Andrea Aparcio-Castro, Daniel Ellingworth, Angelo Moretti, Harry Taylor, Nissa Finney and James Nazroo   
   
We discuss the challenges of implementing and adjusting    a large-scale non-probability web survey.    For the application, we focus on the   2021 Evidence for Equality National Survey (EVENS) which was led by the Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity (CoDE) at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, in partnership with Ipsos-MORI. The aim was to understand the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on ethnic and religious minority groups in the UK.  Standard probability-based surveys, even with ethnic minority group boosts, do not have the sample sizes required to obtain reliable estimates for small group statistics. We therefore designed a   non-probability web survey of ethnic minority groups to overcome these limitations. We formed partnerships with community organizations and used innovative recruitment strategies, including digital and social media. Daily   monitoring of the data collection against desired sample sizes and R-indicator calculations allowed the team to focus attention on the recruitment of specific groups   in a responsive data collection mode.  We also supplemented the sample with existing   members in both established non-probability and probability-based panels in the UK.   We describe the measures    applied to improve the quality of the collected data and the statistical adjustments to correct for selection and coverage biases based on estimating the probability   of participation in the non-probability sample using    combined   probability reference samples followed by calibration to auxiliary information from the UK Census 2021.  We demonstrate how a pseudo-population bootstrap approach can be designed to obtain bootstrap weights to allow for statistical analyses and inference.

Investigating the quality of digital trace and data donation

Challenges to traditional survey data collection such as increased costs and decreasing non-response are leading survey researchers to explore new forms of data. Recently, two types of data have received increased focus as a possible replacements or enhancements of surveys: digital trace data and data donation. Digital trace data refers to data produced while individuals interact with digital platforms, such as apps and websites. Data donation, on the other hand, refers to the acquisition of data from online platforms, such as Facebook or Google, directly from users. In a recent study we use an experimental design in a non-probability panel in Germany to explore non-response bias in data donated from Facebook as well measurement error in digital trace data from PCs and mobile phones.

We conducted a study of nearly 4000 eighth-grade students attending 114 public and private schools in the western Chitwan Valley of Nepal. In this study, we measured students’ academic achievement at the beginning and end of eighth grade, collected data from students’ families, and used multiple methods to measure governance arrangements and instructional practices at schools. We find that public and private schools in the study did indeed engage in different governance practices. However, we found that governance practices in schools were unrelated to instructional practices in schools, even though some of the instructional practices we measured were positively associated with student’s gains in academic achievement over the eighth grade. We discuss why our findings are rich with implications for research, theory, and public policies focused on the problem of improving student achievement in developing countries. There will be a Q&A session after the presentation.

This should be surprising, given that what they do is inherently meaningful, and that the content of their work is interesting and engages skills that most people find intrinsically rewarding to exercise. I argue that the discontent of so many professionals is likely due to their increasing proletarianization. As professionals become increasingly submerged as employees in large organizations, often operated on a for-profit basis, they suffer losses of professional autonomy. The organizations they work for operate on a managerial logic that disdains and suppresses the kinds of local, personal, practical knowledge that professionals cultivate and need to exercise to do their jobs well. I explore the contrasts between the kind of knowledge managers use to pursue organizational goals and the kind of knowledge professionals use in their everyday interactions with patients, students, and clients, to explain the pervasive burnout of professionals in large organizations.",https://events.umich.edu/event/114361,Ross School of Business,R0240,Ross School of Business,,Data Collection,"Interdisciplinary Committee on Organizational Studies - ICOS

Flexible Formal Privacy for Public Data Curation

Researchers rely extensively on public datasets disseminated by official statistics agencies, universities, non-governmental organizations, and other data curators. With the increasing availability of data and computing power comes increased threats to privacy, as published statistics can more easily be used to reconstruct sensitive personal data. Formal privacy (FP) methods, like differential privacy (DP), provably limit such information leakage by injecting carefully chosen randomized noise into published statistics. However, the way DP accounts for privacy degradation requires this noise be injected into every statistic dependent on the confidential dataset. This fails to reflect data curator needs, social, legal or ethical requirements, and complex dependency structures between public and confidential datasets. In this talk, I'll discuss statistical methodology that addresses these problems. We propose a FP framework with novel characterizations of disclosure risk when assessing collections of statistics wherein only some statistics are published with DP guarantees. We demonstrate FP properties maintained by our proposed framework, propose data release mechanisms which satisfy our proposed definition, and prove the optimality properties of downstream statistical estimators based on these mechanism outputs. For this talk, I'll discuss a few end-to-end data analysis examples in public health and surveys, showing how theoretical trade-offs between privacy, utility, and computation time manifest in practice when assessing disclosure risks and statistical utility. I'll conclude with a discussion on the implications of this work for survey researchers, focusing on opportunities to incorporate privacy by design in survey planning, experimental design, and other data collection operations.

This study examines the use of two-sided labor market platforms as a private governance solution to protect vulnerable workers in contexts where the power dynamics between employers and workers are highly unequal. Specifically, we collaborated with a Singapore-based online platform that connects foreign domestic workers with employers (families). In this setting, it is not uncommon for workers to be mistreated by employers via various forms of exploitation and abuse. The collaborating platform was interested in exploring whether introducing a new rating system that allows workers to rate employers could improve this situation for workers. Accordingly, we randomized communication about such a rating system and examined how each side of the platform reacted. We found that employers did not respond positively to the rating system, though their negative reaction was offset if they were nudged to consider the instrumental benefits of the intervention for them. Surprisingly, workers also disliked the idea of the rating system, despite it being intended to protect and empower them. Post-hoc analysis and interviews suggest that the most vulnerable workers were particularly concerned about the employer-rating system. Our paper illustrates that, in settings with large power differentials, platform governance mechanisms intended to help vulnerable workers could have unintended negative consequences. It thus highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced determinants of vulnerable workers’ challenges when considering whether platform governance might improve or exacerbate them.",https://events.umich.edu/event/114388,Ross School of Business,R0240,Ross School of Business,,Data Collection,"Interdisciplinary Committee on Organizational Studies - ICOS

Using Synergies Between Survey Statistics and Causal Inference to Improve Transportability of Clinical Trials

Medical researchers have understood for many years that treatment effect estimates obtained from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) -- termed efficacy'' -- can differ from those obtained in a general population -- termed effectiveness''. Only in the past decade has extensive work begun in the statistical literature to bridge this gap using formal quantitative methods. As noted by Rod Little in a letter to the editor in the New Yorker ...randomization in randomized clinical trials concerns the allocation of the treatment, not the selection of individuals for the study. The latter can have an important impact on the average size of a treatment effect,'' with RCT samples often designed, sometimes explicitly, to be more likely to include individuals for whom the treatment may be more effective.

This issue has been various termed generalizability'' or transportability."" Why do we care about transportability? In RCTs we are in the happy situation were treatment assignment is randomized, so confounding due to either observed or unobserved (pre-treatment) covariates is not an issue. But while randomization of treatment eliminates the effect of unobserved confounders, at least net of non-compliance, it does not eliminate the effect of unobserved effect modifiers, which can impact the causal effect of treatment in a population that differs from the RCT sample population. The impact of these interactions on the marginal effect of treatment thus can differ between the RCT population and the final population of interest.

Concurrent with research into transportability has been research into making population inference from non-probability samples. There is a close overlap between these two approaches, particularly with respect to the non-probability inference methods that rely on information from a relevant probability sample of the target population to reduce selection bias effects. When there are relevant censuses or probability samples of the target patient population of interest, these methods can be adapted to transport information from the RCT to the patient population. Because the RCT setting focuses on causal inference, this adaptation involves extensions to estimate counterfactuals. Thus approaches that treat population inference as a missing data problem are a natural fit to connect these two strands of methodological innovation.

In particular, we propose to extend a pseudo-weighting'' methodology from other non-probability settings to a doubly robust'' estimator that treats sampling probabilities or weights as regression covariates to achieve consistent estimation of population quantities. We explore our proposed approach and compare with some standard existing methods in a simulation study to assess the effectiveness of the approach under differing degrees of selection bias and model misspecification, and compare it with results obtained using the RT data only and with existing methods that use inverse probability weights. We apply it to a study of pulmonary artery catheterization in critically ill patients where we believe differences between the trial sample and the larger population might impact overall estimates of treatment effects.",https://events.umich.edu/event/108977,Off Campus Location,"Room 1070, Institute for Social Research",Virtual,,Data Collection,"Michigan Program in Survey and Data Science
